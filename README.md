# Access Log Stats library #

This library is intended for generating useful statistics from access logs
commonly generated by server software such as apache. Currently this library
has been written mostly for my own needs and purposes to provide me with the
details I want to know. Thus, the code will not be well documented and it may
not be fit for all general purposes.

## Usage ##

The basic idea is to have the parser and supply it with reports that consist
of filters and views. Filters are used to remove rows not relevant to that
report and views determine what kind of information should be extracted from
the row.

For example:

```php
<?php
$parser = new Riimu\LogParser\LogParser(
    new Riimu\LogParser\Source\AccessLogSource('access.log'),
    'output');
$report = new Riimu\LogParser\Report('Referrers for www subdomain');
$report->addFilter(new Riimu\LogParser\Filter\FilterDomain('www.example.com'));
$report->addView((new Riimu\LogParser\View\ReferrerView())
    ->addInternalDomain('www.example.com'));

$parser->addReport($report);
$parser->process();
$parser->saveJSON();
```

The above code will generate the information about referrers for the subdomain
'www' of your 'example.com' site.
